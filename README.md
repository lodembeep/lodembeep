# 📌 Lodembeep's GitHub Profile  

Hey, I'm **Lodembeep** — a backend junkie who loves diving deep into the tech stack and building stuff that actually works. I’m all about **Node.js** (and its cousins **Bun** and **Deno**) to craft powerful apps and systems. Oh, and did I mention I’m an **AI skeptic**? But, you know, still cool with exploring the possibilities.  

### 🚀 About Me  
- 💚 **Node.js** is my jam (and I’m all about the flavors like **Bun** and **Deno**)  
- 🌍 Crafting sleek UIs with **Quasar Framework** and building **Tauri** apps that run anywhere  
- 🗄️ Love working with **MongoDB** and **MySQL** for all things data  
- ⚡ **APIs** are my second language, I like them fast, websockets crispy, and **GSQL** makes me happy  
- 🖥️ Backend dev for life — frontend? I can do it, but don't expect miracles 😅  
- 🛠️ I live for **servers**, **Linux** is my daily (mostly **Ubuntu**), and building **microarchitectures** is my jam — writing APIs, deploying servers, automating scripts, and managing **DMZs**  
- 💸 **Crypto since 2014** — watched it grow from a niche thing to the wild ride it is now  
- 🤮 **PHP** and **Laravel**? Just… no.  
- 🚫 **Java**? Nope, can’t do it, won’t do it, don't make me.  

### 💥 Feats I’m Proud Of  
- 🏦 Built a **crypto bank** backend  
- 💎 Developed an **awesome crypto wallet**  
- 📧 Built my own **emailing server** using **Mailcow**
