# 📌 Lodembeep: Backend Architect | DevOps Expert | Startup Builder

I’m not here to write basic code. I take the tech that others worship and make it mine, from building startups that disrupt to crafting systems that just work—no hype, no fluff. My backend doesn’t just run; it scales, adapts, and grows. The tools I use? They’re just that—tools. It's the architecture and the approach that matter. Crypto? Cool, but I’m here to create, not chase the buzz.

### 🚀 About Me  
- 💚 **Node.js** is my jam (with **Bun** and **Deno** tagging along)  
- 🌍 Building slick UIs with **Quasar Framework** and cross-platform apps with **Tauri**  
- 🗄️ Messing with **MongoDB** and **MySQL** for all things data  
- ⚡ **APIs** are my bread and butter, websockets keep things spicy, and **GSQL** is growing on me  
- 🖥️ **Backend dev** first and foremost — frontend happens when necessary 😅  
- 🛠️ **DevOps** is my playground — I know what I’m doing and love every bit of it! Managing **Linux** servers (mostly **Ubuntu**), deploying servers, writing automation scripts, experimenting with **microarchitectures**, and keeping things secure in **DMZs** — always learning, always improving  
- 💸 **Crypto since 2014** — been through the booms, busts, and everything in between  
- 🤮 **PHP** and **Laravel**? Hard pass.  
- 🚫 **Java**? Yeah, no thanks.  

### 💥 Feats I’m Proud Of  
- 🏦 Built a **crypto bank** backend  
- 💎 Developed an **awesome crypto wallet**  
- 📧 Built my own **emailing server** using **Mailcow**
